            <h1>1. Input Unit</h1>
            <li>Input is any data or instruction enterd into the 
                memory of a computer
            </li>
            <li>Any hardware component allows user to enter data and
                instructions in to a computer
            </li>

            <br>

            <h1>Keyboard</h1>
            <img src="Keyboard.png" height="100" width="400">
            <li>Used to enter information into the computer
                and for giving commands.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>A standard computer keyboard is called a QWERTY keyboard.</li>
            
            <br><br>

            <h1>Ball Mouse</h1>
            <img src="BallMouse.png" height="200" width="200">
            <li>An input device operated by rolling its ball across a flat surface.
                The mouse is used to control the on-screen pointer by pointing 
                and clicking, double-clicking, or dragging objects on the screen.
            </li>

            <br><br>

            <h1>Optical Mouse</h1>
            <img src="BallMouse.png" height="200" width="200">
            <li>It is an advanced computer pointing device.</li>
            <li>it uses Light-Emitting Diode(LED) in place of the traditional mouse ball.
            </li>
            <li>Movement is detected by sensing changes in reflected light.</li>
            
            <br><br>

            <h1>2. Output Unit</h1>
            <li>The job of ouput unit is just the reverse of that of an
                Input Unit.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>It supplies information and results of computation to
                the outside world.
            </li>

            <br><br>

            <h1>Monitor</h1>
            <img src="Monitor.png" height="200" width="200">
            <li>A display screen is used to provide "ouput" to
                the user. It is where you can view the 
                information you are working on.
            </li>

            <h1>Printer</h1>
            <img src="printer.png" height="200" width="200">
            <li>And ouput device that prodeuces a hard of the information.
                Information to the user is in pronted form.
            </li>

            <h1>3. Memory / Storage Devices</h1>
            <li>All computer need to store data</li>

            <br>

            <li>Data is stored temporally while program is running
                    -Main Memory.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>To store data for long-term, to preserve programs and data
                while not in use - Backing Storage.
            </li>

            <br>

            <h1>Hard Disk</h1>
            <img src="HardDisk.png" height="200" width="200">
            <li> Access to data is far faster than access to data in floppy disks.</li>
            <li>Read/Write head is positioned close to the disk</li>
            <li>Disk is attached to a spindle</li>
